This is a simple Stone Paper Scissor Game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows the player to choose between "Stone," "Paper," and "Scissor," and plays against the computer. The choices are made by clicking the corresponding buttons, and the result of the game (whether the player wins, loses, or draws) is displayed along with the updated scores.

Features:
HTML: Provides the structure of the game, including buttons for the player's choices and sections to display the game result and scores.
CSS: Used for styling the game interface, making it visually appealing and interactive.
JavaScriptâ€‹: Contains the game logic, including the decision-making process of the computer's move, comparison of choices, and score tracking.
The game keeps track of both the player's and the computer's scores throughout the session, displaying the result of each round and updating the scores in real time.

This project is perfect for beginners looking to practice their skills with interactive web development using the core technologies of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
